## Docker

| Script                                             | Description                                                     |

## Environment variables

Create a `.env` in the root directory and set the following variables.

```
PORT=
MODE=
BASE_API=
```

## Developer guidelines

#### 1. Use absolute path instead of relative path for `containers`, `general`, `views`, `scss` and `utils` folder.

Relative path

```
import Header from '../../components/containers/Header';
```

Absolute path

```
import Header from 'containers/Header';
```

<sub>Used webpack resolve.alias to make modules import or require easy.</sub>

#### 2. Update the `utils/config.js` with your enivronmental variables.

```
const config = {
	API: {
		url: process.env.BASE_API,
	},
    SAMPLE_DATA: process.env.sample
};
```

#### 3. Replace `react_boilerplate` project name with your project name in docker files.

#### 4. #components/containers

- Split points for major components on a website. For example: Header, Footer, Sidebar.

#### 5. #components/general

- Are concerned with how things look.
- Don't specify how the data is loaded.
- Receive data exclusively via props.
- Rarely have their own state (when they do, it’s UI state rather than data).
- React components that are driven solely by props and don't talk to Redux. Same as “dumb components”.

#### 6. #components/views

- Are concerned with how things work.
- Provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components.
- Most of the type are stateful
- are aware of Redux, Router, etc
